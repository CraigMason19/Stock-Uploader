# Stock Uploader

### Overview
A program I built when working at a stationary wholesalers to create a .csv file of current stock levels that could be uploaded to the e-Commerce system. For easily changing the stock record for all items listed on the website.  

Built in C# using WinForms.\
Program Icon use from https://icons8.com

### Extra Information
The Program reads two files (By dragging them into the picture boxes): an Excel file (.xls) file created from a Sage stock report; and a .csv file exported from the e-Commerce system of all products currently on the site. 

It then matches product codes between the two and updates to the Sage stock level. This was the master data, any new deliveries during the day were updated here.

Some website products codes were not updated as they were online only codes (e.g. sets of more than 1 item).   

This program helped to make sure the website was always correct at end of day.
